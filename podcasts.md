## Selected Podcast Episodes

Some "evergreen" episodes were recorded in the last couple of years. Again, this
is a personal selection so it is biased towards certain guests and topics.

{% include sodes.html %}

I am still in the process of going through the archives, so this list will
probably grow over time. If there is an episode missing that you consider
one of the best, feel free to [reach out to me][contact] and shill me said
episode.
