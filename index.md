**Kurz und Knapp:** Lese zumindest den [Den Bitcoin Standard][bitcoin-standard]
und [Das Bullishe Argument für Bitcoin][bullish-case-book].

---

## Essentials

To get a grasp on Bitcoin you will have to read a book or two.  If you only want
to read one book, most people will recommend Saifedean's **[The Bitcoin
Standard][the-bitcoin-standard]**, and for good reason. Bitcoin is money, so
understanding [The Ethics of Money Production][the-ethics-of-money-production]
is paramount to understanding what Bitcoin is about. If you need a crash-course
in economics, read [Economics in One Lesson][economics-in-one-lesson] by Henry
Hazlitt.

If you prefer a shorter introduction, read and listen to the following:

- [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin][bullish-case-book] by Vijay Boyapati
- [The Stories We Tell About Money][aantonop-stories] by Andreas Antonopoulos

Further, everyone who is serious about trying to understand Bitcoin should start
at the beginning, and read -- or at least skim -- the 8 pages which gave birth
to Bitcoin:

- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][bitcoin-whitepaper] by Satoshi Nakamoto
